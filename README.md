# üé∂ Hertz Music Streaming Service

A relational database project built with MySQL for Hertz, a music streaming service inspired by platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. The project showcases SQL scripts for creating and populating tables, with a focus on SQL schema design, data modeling, and complex querying. Designed to handle large-scale data efficiently, this database management system ensures fast, responsive performance while managing user data, music libraries, playlists, subscriptions, and more. It highlights the importance of a well-structured DBMS for seamless data storage, retrieval, and scalability.
